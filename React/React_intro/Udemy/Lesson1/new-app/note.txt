Props are object that hold infomation to control behaviour of a component. But problem with Props
is that they are immutable. 

State is also an object tht holds some information but that infomation may change over the lifetime
of the component. That makes state more dynamic to use.

Props: Passed to the component. So a component is nothing but a function, it's like a parameter which
is being passed to that function. Props behaviour similar function. Props are immutable. Props can be accessed 
as props -> this.props. They are like parameters passed to a function. 

State: Contained inside component.State can be change. 
Function: useState Hook
Class: this.state
State like-> they are like variables declared in the function body.
