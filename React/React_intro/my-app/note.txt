JXS: we can write HtML code in Javascript and React works with Babel.
And we can also write js code in HTML. 

like: const todoTitle = "Call family";

ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
    <h1>Todo APP</h1>
    <h3>{todoTitle}</h3>                //use JavaScript code inside HTML
    <p>Hello all, how are all!</p>
    </div>
)

 Babel is a widely used JavaScript compiler that is often associated with React and modern JavaScript 
 development. 
 Babel:
Babel is a tool that helps developers write modern JavaScript code while ensuring that it can be run on older 
browsers that might not support the latest JavaScript features. It's commonly referred to as a "transpiler" 
or "compiler" because it takes in modern JavaScript code (written in the latest ECMAScript standards) and 
transforms it into an older version of JavaScript that's compatible with a wider range of browsers.
