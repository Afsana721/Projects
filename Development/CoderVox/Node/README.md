What is DOM: Document Object Model. 
Here, we are going to attach JavaScript to our Webpages. In order to do that, we need to talk about the DOM. DOM, it's not a language, not a part of HTML or JavaScript. It's a separate technology that allows us to use JavaScript to manipulate the contents of a Webpage.

What is Document Object Model (DOM)
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating HTML documents.

The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree of nodes. The DOM provides functions that allow you to add, remove, and modify parts of the document effectively.

Note that the DOM is cross-platform and language-independent ways of manipulating HTML and XML documents.

Document: The document is the web page. So, DOM takes our HTML elements that means, the HTML elements become objects and each object represents a different piece of the page that is in the browser. 

That means: <h1>Text</h1> -> as a object or 
            <body> ...</body> as a object, etc, also entire html document is also as a object. 

DOM: document Object Model means a data model . The DOM make a tree a model of Webpage.

Hight level: Document -> then HTML -> head, body,
                        head -> title
                        body -> h1, div, script ... like.
So, document object could be easy or complex depending the HTML structure but this is how the DOM sees our web page.

Nodes: nodes is any DOM object. Like: <p> tag could be node, <input> tag could be a node, the document itself could be a node.
