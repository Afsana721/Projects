CommandLine: 
    - In the 70's and 80's, coputers didn't have graphical user interfaces (windows, incons, etc.). If we wanted to use a computer, we have to use the command line. 
So, the reasons to use command line: 
    - there are programming tasks taht can only be performed in the command line (for example, Node.js)
    - Typing commands is faste than using the mouse or trackpad. 

Things we can do in the command line: 
    - Navigate folders on our cpmputer
    - Display files
    - Make and delete files
    - Start / stop applications
