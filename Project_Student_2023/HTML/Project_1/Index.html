        <img src="Assets/Jon Arbuckle.jpg" alt="Jon Arbuckel">
        <P>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in
            Muncie,
            Indiana.I am the proud owner of a cat named Garfield and a dog name Odie. Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to
            eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain. Although my pets drive me crazy, I can't imagine life without
            them.
        </P>
        <p>I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make
            sure to
            buy all of Garfield's favorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, harm,
            chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <b>lots and lots</b> of lasanga.
            When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in the grocery bag before I even
            have time to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that I bought in 30 seconds, and I hav
            to go back to the store to buy more food.<i> I wasn't too happy about that</i>.</p>
