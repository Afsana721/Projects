-CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML
, or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech or  on other media.

CSS Cascading means water fall - it works top to down- if we use same selector different value,
it will work last one (down).
