Step1: .socialIcoms a: This rule applies to the anchor tags wrapping the icons. I added the transition property to create a
 smooth transition effect when the background color changes. The original background color was set to white, which 
 was causing the icons to have a white background.

Step2: .socialIcoms a i: This rule applies to the icons within the anchor tags. I set the color property to black with an 
opacity of 0.9 to match the original styling. I also added the transition property for a smooth color change effect.

Step3: .socialIcoms a:hover: This rule applies when hovering over the anchor tags (icons). I changed the background-color 
to transparent using the rgba value (0 alpha), which means the background will gradually fade out and become completely 
transparent on hover.

Step4: .socialIcoms a:hover i: This rule applies to the icons within the anchor tags when hovering. I changed the color property 
to white on hover to ensure the icons are visible against the dark background.
