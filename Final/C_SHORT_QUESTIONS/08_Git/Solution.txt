How do you delete a local branch after completing work on it.  How would you delete a remote branch?

Ans: 
    b1: How do you delete a local branch after completing work on it.
    First make sure that I am on the master branch, if not then checkout master branch. So to see all branches by
    git checkout branch
    git checkout master
    git branch -d <branch-name> or git branch -D <branch-name>

Ans:
    b2: How would you delete a remote branch?
    First push the deletion to the remote repository, this can be done by 
    git push        then come for the delete section
    git push origin --delete<remote-branch-name>

    Then I will verify the deletion is happend or not - after pushig deletion reference, the remote branch will be 
    removed from the remote repository. I can verify by checking the repository on the remote server (github), or 
    by running 
    git fetch --prune           prune will remove reference to remote branches that no longer exits.
