### INSTRUCTIONS:

This exercise is designed to test your knowledge of the front end as well as how to consume an external API while using React. We have provided the React application here. However, it doesn't work as expected due to one or several bugs. Find and fix as many bugs as you can, to render the app as shown in the image below.

Notes: 

- Do not just re-write the app, but fix the bugs in the provided code.

- Each bug-fix change should have meaningful comments (no auto generation from online or automated resources) else credit. You must show evidence of understanding your code, else you will not receive credit for your work.

- The app uses the StarWars API. https://swapi.dev/.  Read over the documentation and familiarize yourself with how to use it.

- The page should display the name, height, mass, hair and eye color of a character. (Displayed results should be all 10 of the provided Starwars characters).
