we can declare variable without declare datatype.
REPL: Read Eval Print Loop - we can use dev tool to use javascript console
Operators:  typeof  instanceof with are represent by string keywords not character
expression: In JavaScript, an expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be as simple 
as a single constant value or a more complex combination of variables, operators, and functions that are evaluated to result in a value.
Example: 
Numeric Expression-- 5 + 3 * 2
String Expression-- "Hello, " + "world!"
Variable Reference-- let x = 10;  and x * 2
Function Call-- Math.sqrt(25)

Conditional Expression (Ternary Operator)-- age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor"  --> 
Let's break down the expression:
age: This refers to a variable that presumably holds the age of a person.
age >= 18: This is the condition being evaluated. It checks if the value of age is greater than or equal to 18.
If the condition is true (meaning the person's age is 18 or greater), the value "Adult" will be returned. 
If the condition is false (meaning the person's age is less than 18), the value "Minor" will be returned.

Array Element Access-- let arr = [1, 2, 3];  find array value -  arr[1];
Object Property Access-- let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };   find person Property - person.name
Logical Expression-- (x > 5) && (y < 10)
Assignment Expression-- let total = price * quantity;


Function: JavaScript is a functional programming language. So, function are first class citizen of the language.
There is a very thin line between objects and function in JavaScript.We can create function as data or object which
means we can even pass the function itself as an argument to a functon.
Example: 
function namefunction () {
    return 1;
}
namefunction();
also: var x = namefunction();

Block Scope: ??

Type Conversion: "4" * "6" ->24  or "4" * 6  ->24 -- allow but if -> "4" +"6" -> 46 -jsut added both strings.


Object & its properties
JSON
Array
Commonly used function

What are JS Object: JavaScript provides a general object data wiich is basically an unorderd collection of properties
and each property has name & value. 
Object: var name = {};  empty object.
var car = {
    color : "green",
    brand: "toyota",
    model: "dx"
};

another way to create object
var car = new Object();
Example: 
var car = new Object();
car;

car.color = "red";
car.model ="wy";
car.brand = "Honda";

car;


create object by 
var x = Object.create(null);   //empty object
