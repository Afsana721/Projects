JavaScript variable createion using: var, let & const
var : is the function scope
let : is block scope
const: is constant - after declar it, the value will be constant, not possible to change.

JavaScript Data type: It is dynamically typed language, no need to declar data type (no need
 to assin data type explicitly. ), when 
assin value, it will fix the data type. 
Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Primitive

Object, Array, Function, Date, Regx, Non-Primitive, (Object)


JavaScript Operator: 
What is Operator: 
    - Operator is a symbol which will perform certain operation
    - For example, if we take a simple expression,  4+5 = 9. 
    - Here 4 and 5 are called operands and  '+' is called the Operator.
    - JavaScript consists of different types of operators that are used to perform different operations.
In JavaScript has different types of Operators: 
            - Arithmetic Operators: These operators used to do mathmatic calculation
                    +,-, *, ** (Exponentiation from ES2016), / (division), % (Modulus / division Remaninder),
                     ++ , --  
                        ** Exponentiation: the operation of raising one quantity to the power of another.   
           
            - Assignment Operators (Shorthand operators): =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

            - Relational / Comparison Operators : 
                ==      equal to, 
                ===     equal value & equal type
                !=      not equal
                !==     not equal value or not equal type
                ?       ternary operator.

            - Logical Operators: && logic and, || logic or , ! logic not
