JavaScript Function:
    - A JavaScript Function is a block of statements which will perform a specific task.
    - A JavaScript Function is executed when "something' invokes it (calls it).
Example:
    functio name (parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
        //statements to be executed
    }

Why Functions required?
    - We can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
    - We can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
