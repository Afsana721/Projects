ES6 Info: Javascript was invented by a programmer named Brenden Eich in 1995, who worked
for Netscape. Netscape were teh creators of a popular web browser at the time. Javascript
historically has had multiple names, it was originally called 'Mocha', then 'LiveScript'. 
Three months after it was released, it was changed to 'Javascript'. 

Organinzation called ECMA international created standared that all browsers could conform to.
ES6 released 2015, known as ES2015, there is a ES2016(ES7), ES2017(ES8),ES2018(ES9), etc.

Javascript var, let or const to declare variable in Javascript.
    var - scope-> function, redeclare is yes, & reassign is yes.
    let - scope-> block, redeclare is no, & reassign is yes.
    const - scope-> block, redeclare is no, & reassign is no. 
const is slightly mesleading because it doesn't define a constant value. 
    It actually defines a constant reference to a value.
    We can't change privitive datatypes, but we can change the properites of objects
like: const lunch = {dessert: "chocolate chip muffin"};
    lunch.dessert = "Oatmeal raisin cookie";
