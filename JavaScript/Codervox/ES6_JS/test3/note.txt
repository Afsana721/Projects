Arrow functions in JS
    Arrow functions provide an alternate way to write a function expression, 
    and it has a shorter syntax.
like: const introduction = () => {
    console.log("hi, how are you?");
}

we can pass argument inside function parameter
like:  const introduction = (name) => {
    console.log("hi" +name + ", how are you?");
}

Arrow function: 
    we can shorten our arrow functions even more using implicit returns. This only works if the function contains a 
    single statement that returns a value. So, we can change this:
    
    const hey = () => {
        return "Hey!";
    }

    To this, by removing the return keyword and changing the curly braces to parentheses:
    const hey = () => {
        "Hey!"
    };
